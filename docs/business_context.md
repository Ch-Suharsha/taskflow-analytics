# TaskFlow: Fictional Business Context

## Company Overview

**TaskFlow** is a fictional Series D B2B SaaS company that builds project management software for mid-market teams (50-500 employees). Think of it as a next-gen competitor to Asana and Monday.com.

## Business Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) | $50M |
| Active Workspaces | 15,000 |
| Monthly Active Users | 45,000 |
| Average Contract Value | $3,300/year |
| Net Revenue Retention | 108% |
| CAC Payback | 14 months |

## Product Context

TaskFlow's core functionality includes:
- **Kanban Boards** — drag-and-drop task management
- **Time Tracking** — built-in timer with reports (premium)
- **Automation Rules** — if/then workflow automation (premium)
- **Custom Fields** — flexible data tracking (premium)
- **Reporting Dashboard** — analytics for team leads
- **Integrations** — Slack, Google Drive, and more

## The Challenge

Growth has been slowing for 2 consecutive quarters. The Head of Product has asked the analytics team to uncover why activation rates are declining and which features should be prioritized to improve retention.

## Key Questions

1. Why are users churning after signup? (Onboarding friction)
2. Which features create the most long-term value? (Feature-retention correlation)
3. Are there revenue opportunities in the existing user base? (Undermonetized segments)
4. What should we build next? (Roadmap prioritization)
